## ðŸ§  Overview

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optionally a basic web interface for predictions.

## âœ… Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Trained models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Optionally includes a web-based interface (Flask/Streamlit)
